# Data-Analysis-using-SQL

The goal of this project is to perform data cleaning and in-depth data analysis on a laptop dataset using SQL directly on the database. 
This approach offers several benefits, including improved efficiency, data integrity, and data security.

The project will involve analyzing the laptop dataset to identify any missing, inconsistent, or inaccurate data, and cleaning the dataset to ensure it is fit for analysis
